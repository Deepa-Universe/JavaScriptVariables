# JavaScriptVariables

This file has Let, Var, Const variables and understanding the difference of how they function.

Difference- For 'var', if variable is used before initialization, it gives 'undefined', for 'let' and 'const' it will throw exception, cannot use variable before initialization.


Important Note- Whether we use 'let','var','const'- Variable names must always be unique and not same.
//Identifier 'xyz' has already been declared
